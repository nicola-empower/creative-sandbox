Here is the blueprint for Lumina Creative.

1. The Visual Identity
We are going for "Cyber-Minimalism." It looks expensive but energetic.

Primary Colour: Electric Purple (#BF00FF) — This is your "action" colour (buttons, hover states).

Background: Deep Black (#050505) — Not pure black, but close. Softens the eyes.

Text: Off-White (#F0F0F0) — Pure white is too harsh on a black background.

Secondary Accent: Acid Green (#CCFF00) — Use this sparingly (e.g., for the cursor or a single "New" badge).

2. Typography
Since you are coding this, let's grab some Google Fonts that scream "Digital Authority."

Headings (The Loud Part): Syne or Clash Display.

Why: They are bold, geometric, and look very "custom code" rather than "standard WordPress template."

Body Text (The Readable Part): Space Grotesk or Inter.

Why: Clean, tech-focused, and easy to read on dark backgrounds.

3. Page Content & Structure
Here is the copy and layout. You can literally copy-paste this into your HTML structure.

Navigation Bar
Left: LUMINA (Logo - text based, bold)

Right: Work | Studio | Contact | [ ☀/☾ Toggle Icon ]

Section 1: The Hero (The Tech Flex)
Visual: Solid black background. Large, centred text.

The Code Element: The typewriter effect on the last word.

Headline (H1):

We don't just build websites. We build [ Brands / Legacies / Hype ] (This part cycles/animates)

Sub-headline:

Digital strategies for the brave. Stop whispering. Start shouting.

CTA Button: [ START THE PROJECT ] (Electric Purple background, sharp corners).

Section 2: The "Flex" (Social Proof)
Layout: A horizontal scrolling ticker or a simple 3-column grid.

Content:

400% ROI for Client X

1.2M Impressions Generated

No Boring Campaigns

Section 3: Selected Work (The Images)
Layout: Asymmetrical grid (one large image left, two small images right). This shows you can code CSS Grid, not just Flexbox.

Caption:

Project: Neon Drift Result: Viral Launch Link: View Case Study →

Section 4: The Pitch (About Us)
Heading: The Method.

Copy:

You’ve seen enough templates. So have your customers. Lumina creates bespoke digital experiences that stick. We combine raw creativity with clean code to disrupt your industry.

Core Stack: Strategy / Design / Development.

Section 5: Contact (The Smooth Scroll Destination)
Heading: Ready to break the internet?

Copy:

Drop your details. We’ll bring the energy.

Form Fields: Name, Email, "What's the vibe?" (Dropdown), Message.

Submit Button: [ SEND IT ]

Footer
Lumina Creative © 2025.

Small text: Coded by Empower Digital Solutions.

4. Technical Checklist (For your Portfolio)
To make sure this impresses potential clients for Empower Digital Solutions, ensure you hit these points:

The Toggle: When they click the Sun/Moon, ensure the background flips to White and the Text to Black instantly (using CSS variables).

Smooth Scroll: When clicking "Contact" in the nav, use scroll-behavior: smooth; in your CSS so it glides down.

Responsiveness: Make sure that "Typewriter" text doesn't break on a mobile screen (use clamp() for font sizes).

The Tech Stack (The "Flex")
Don't use a basic HTML/CSS setup. Use a stack that clients pay premium for.

Framework: Next.js (React).

Why: It’s the industry standard for high-performance, SEO-friendly sites. It shows you can build "web apps," not just pages.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Why: It allows you to build that "Dark Mode" toggle efficiently using CSS variables.

Animation: Framer Motion or GSAP.

Why: This is how you get that "Typewriter" effect and the smooth scroll without it feeling clunky.

Hosting: Vercel.

Why: It’s free for portfolios, incredibly fast, and integrates perfectly with Next.js.

2. The Imagery: "Cyber-Minimalism"
You asked "Images of what?" Since the vibe is loud and tech-forward, avoid stock photos of "people shaking hands."

Theme: Controlled Chaos.

Hero Section: Abstract 3D Liquid/Chrome.

Search Terms: "Liquid chrome shapes," "3D abstract metallic flow," "Neon fluid render."

Vibe: Shiny, futuristic, slightly weird. It implies "we shape your brand."

Team Section: Glitch Effect Portraits.

Idea: Take a normal photo of a person (or use a stylistic AI generator) and apply a CSS filter that shifts the RGB channels slightly.

Vibe: Shows you can manipulate images with code.

Case Studies: Device Mockups on Dark Glass.

Idea: Don't just show a screenshot of a website. Place the screenshot inside an iPhone frame that is floating on a dark, glassy background.

Search Terms: "Clay iPhone mockup dark," "Glassmorphism UI presentation."

Background Textures: Grain/Noise.

Idea: Overlay a very subtle "noise" texture (like TV static) over the black background at 5% opacity. It makes the black look premium, not empty.

3. Content: More than a Brochure
A "Brochure Site" dies after the user reads it once. A "Digital Experience" keeps them clicking. To show off your backend/database skills (for Empower Automation), add these sections:

A. The "Playground" (or "Labs")
Instead of just a blog, call it Lumina Labs.

Content: Small, interactive code experiments.

Example: A button that explodes when clicked. A cursor that trails neon dust.

Text Content: "We don't just follow trends. We code them. Welcome to our sandbox of digital experiments."

Why: It proves you love code, not just templates.

B. The "Manifesto" (Instead of 'About Us')
"About Us" is boring. "The Manifesto" is Gen-Z.

Headline: "Average is invisible."

Copy:

We believe the internet is crowded. To stand out, you don't need to be louder; you need to be different. We reject safe designs. We reject the template. We build digital violence—brands that smash through the noise and demand attention.

Our Philosophy:

Code is Art: If it loads slow, it’s ugly.

User Obsessed: We stalk your customers (legally) to know what they click.

Data Driven: Creativity without metrics is just decoration.

C. "The Process" (Interactive Step-by-Step)
Show how you work. Use a horizontal scroll here.

Discovery: "We ask the uncomfortable questions."

Strategy: "We build the war map."

Development: "Clean code. No bloat. Pure speed."

Launch: "We don't just push 'live'. We ignite."

4. Summary of the Build
Stack: Next.js + Tailwind.

Key Feature: Dark/Light mode toggle that inverts the neon colours (Purple in dark mode -> Deep Green in light mode).

Images: Chrome/Metallic 3D shapes and Glitch portraits.

Extra Content: A "Manifesto" to show strong copywriting and a "Labs" section to show off JavaScript skills.

This is the hardest part of building a portfolio site: making the "Light Mode" look as cool as the "Dark Mode" without blinding the user.To keep that Loud, Gen-Z, Disruptive vibe in both, we need to treat them differently:Dark Mode = The "Nightclub" (Cyber, Glowing, Immersive).Light Mode = The "Art Gallery" (Stark, Brutalist, High-Contrast).Here is your colour strategy.The Palette: "Electric Voids"We are locking in Electric Purple (#BF00FF) as your primary brand anchor because it pops aggressively on both black and white backgrounds.1. Dark Mode (The Default)The vibe: Coding at 3 AM, neon signs, deep tech.ElementHex CodeColour NameUsageBackground#050505Void BlackThe main canvas.

It pops huge against white.The "Flex"#000000Solid BlackChange: Acid Green disappears here. It becomes thick black borders or "Highlighter" style blocks.How to Style the Elements (The Vibe Check)To ensure they feel like the same brand, you must apply the colours differently in each mode.1. The ButtonsDark Mode: Solid Electric Purple background with White text. It glows.Light Mode: Transparent background with a thick 2px Black Border and Electric Purple text (or hover fill). This feels more "structural" and modern.2. The "Typewriter" TextDark Mode: Text is Acid Green (#CCFF00) or White. It looks like terminal code.Light Mode: Text is Electric Purple (#BF00FF) or Black with a purple background highlight (like a marker pen).3. The Cards (Case Studies)Dark Mode: Glassmorphism. Dark grey background (#1A1A1A) with a subtle white border (rgba(255,255,255, 0.1)).Light Mode: Brutalism. White background with a hard, solid Black shadow (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000). This gives it a "sticker" or "pop-art" feel.The Code Implementation (CSS Variables)Since you are using Empower Digital Solutions to show off your code, use CSS Variables (Custom Properties). This makes the toggle switch instant and performant.Put this in your global CSS file:CSS:root {
  /* Default to Dark Mode Variables */
  --bg-primary: #050505;
  --text-body: #E0E0E0;
  --text-heading: #FFFFFF;
  --brand-color: #BF00FF;
  --accent-flex: #CCFF00; /* Acid Green */
  --card-border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255, 0.1);
  --button-shadow: 0px 0px 15px rgba(191, 0, 255, 0.4); /* Glow effect */
}

[data-theme='light'] {
  /* Light Mode Overrides */
  --bg-primary: #FAFAFA;
  --text-body: #171717;
  --text-heading: #000000;
  --brand-color: #BF00FF; /* Stays the same */
  --accent-flex: #000000; /* Green becomes Black for contrast */
  --card-border: 2px solid #000000;
  --button-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000000; /* Hard shadow, no glow */
}

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-body);
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}
Why this works for you:Dark Mode sells your coding ability (it looks like an IDE/Text Editor).Light Mode sells your design ability (it looks like a modern agency).The Switch: By changing the box-shadow from a "soft glow" in dark mode to a "hard black drop shadow" in light mode, you show attention to detail that standard WordPress themes don't have.

Here is the manifesto text. Since we are ditching the standard "About Us," this copy needs to feel like a declaration of war against boring websites.

I have written three versions. Choose the one that matches how "loud" you want to go.

Option 1: The "Disruptor" (High Energy, Gen-Z Vibe)
Use this if you want to show off the "Loud/Neon" aesthetic. It’s punchy, short, and aggressive.

Headline: AVERAGE IS INVISIBLE.

Body Copy: The internet is a crowded room. Most brands are just standing in the corner, hoping to be noticed. We don't do hope. We kick down the door.

Lumina wasn't built to blend in. We exist to disrupt the scroll. We reject the template, the safe choice, and the "good enough."

Our Code:

Silence is Failure: If your brand doesn't provoke a reaction, it’s dead.

Code is Art: We don't use drag-and-drop. We hand-craft digital violence.

Data Over Ego: Pretty designs are vanity. Conversion is reality.

CTA: Ready to make some noise? [ IGNITE THE BRAND ]

Great choice. **Option 1** is the one that gets people to stop scrolling and start reading. It’s aggressive, confident, and fits the "Electric/Neon" aesthetic perfectly.

Since you are building this in **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS**, here is the code component for the Manifesto section.
****now changed to ASTRO! not next.. 
The Strategy: You treat the static parts (Text, Headers, Footer) as HTML (zero JS). You treat the complex parts (The Toggle, The Hover Menu) as React Islands.

3. The New Stack (Astro Edition)
Framework: Astro

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Interactivity: React (loaded only where needed).

Motion: Framer Motion (inside the React islands) + Astro View Transitions (for page navigation).

4. The "Secret Weapon": Astro View Transitions
Since version 3.0, Astro has a built-in router that mimics the "App-like" feel of Next.js without the complexity.

You add <ViewTransitions /> to your layout head, and suddenly your multi-page website feels like a Single Page App (SPA). The dark mode won't flicker when you change pages. The scroll position is preserved. It is seamless.

How to Implement the "Lumina" features in Astro
Here is how we adapt the code I gave you earlier to work in Astro.

Step 1: The Setup
Bash

npm create astro@latest
# Select: Empty, TypeScript (optional but recommended), Install dependencies
npx astro add react tailwind
Step 2: The Layout (Enable the "App Feel")
In src/layouts/Layout.astro:

Code snippet

---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro:transitions';
import '../styles/global.css'; // Put your CSS variables here
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="scroll-smooth">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<title>Lumina Creative</title>
		<ViewTransitions /> {/* This is the magic line */}
	</head>
	<body class="bg-void-black text-white transition-colors duration-300">
		<slot />
	</body>
</html>

<style is:global>
  /* Your font imports here */
</style>
Step 3: The "Arsenal" Menu (Using a React Island)
You can literally reuse the React code I gave you for the Services page. You just file it as src/components/Arsenal.jsx.

Then, use it in your Astro page like this:

Code snippet

---
// src/pages/services.astro
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Arsenal from '../components/Arsenal.jsx';
---

<Layout>
  <main>
    <h1>Our Services</h1>
    
    <Arsenal client:visible />
    
  </main>
</Layout>
Why this is better: In Next.js, the entire page would be hydrated as React. In Astro, the Header and Footer are plain HTML. The browser only downloads the React code for the Arsenal component when the user sees it.

5. The Motion Plan (Astro Version)
Since you are comfortable with your Automation site's typewriter effect, here is how we level it up for Lumina:

Typewriter: Keep doing what you're doing (likely a small vanilla JS script or a React component).

Smooth Page Swaps: Astro's <ViewTransitions /> handles this automatically. You can even customize it to "Slide Left" or "Fade".

The "Hover Reveal": Use Framer Motion inside your React components.

The Verdict: Stick to Astro.

It respects your existing workflow.

It's performant (which fits the "Empower" brand of efficiency).

It handles the "Loud" creative effects via React Islands perfectly.

It's not "heavy". It's lean and mean.

I have set this up so:

1.  **Dark Mode:** It glows. The text is white/grey. The accents are Neon Purple.
2.  **Light Mode:** It’s stark. The text is heavy black. The accents act like highlighters.

### The Component (`Manifesto.js`)

You can copy-paste this directly into your project.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Manifesto = () => {
  return (
    <section className="relative w-full py-24 px-6 md:px-12 transition-colors duration-300 bg-[#FAFAFA] dark:bg-[#050505]">

### The "Tech Flex" details explained:

1.  **The Headline (`h2`):**
      * **Light Mode:** It is heavy black text.
      * **Dark Mode:** The word "INVISIBLE" gets a `drop-shadow` that makes it look like a real neon sign glowing against the black background.
2.  **The List (`ul`):**
      * I added a border on the left (`border-l-2`).
      * **Light Mode:** The border is Black (Brutalist).
      * **Dark Mode:** The border is Electric Purple (Tech/Cyber).
3.  **The Button:**
      * This is a custom CSS button. It has a "hard shadow" (the border offset) that moves when you hover. It feels tactile and mechanical, not soft and round like a standard website.

### Fonts Reminder

For this code to look right, make sure you have your fonts set up in your `tailwind.config.js`:

  * **font-display:** 'Syne' or 'Clash Display' (For the big headers).
  * **font-body:** 'Space Grotesk' or 'Inter' (For the reading text).
For the Services Page, we need to avoid the standard "Laundry List" of bullet points. That is boring.

Since "Lumina" is a disruptive agency, and Empower Digital Solutions is building it, this page needs to function like a Digital Menu. It should feel tactile, interactive, and heavy on the typography.

Here is the concept: "The Arsenal."

The Concept: Interactive Hover Reveal
Instead of boxes with icons (which looks like a standard WordPress template), we use a massive vertical list.

Default State: Just the Service Names in huge text (Syne/Clash Display font).

Hover State: The text changes colour (Neon Purple), and a relevant image/GIF appears floating near the cursor (or in a fixed preview window).

1. The Page Copy (Loud & Direct)
Page Title: OUR ARSENAL. Subtitle: We don't sell hours. We sell unfair advantages.

Service 01: Brand Identity
The Hook: "Identity Engineering."

The Copy:

A logo is not a brand. A brand is a feeling. It's the gut reaction your customer has when they see you. We build visual systems that turn customers into cult members.

Tags: Visual Language / Tone of Voice / Rebranding / Art Direction.

Service 02: Digital Experience (Web)
The Hook: "Immersive Architecture."

The Copy:

If your website looks like a template, your business looks like a commodity. We code bespoke, high-performance platforms that capture attention and refuse to let go.

Tags: Next.js / 3D WebGL / eCommerce / UI & UX Design.

Service 03: Growth & Hype
The Hook: "Viral Mechanics."

The Copy:

Hope is not a strategy. We use data-driven aggression to hack the algorithm. We create the noise that makes your competitors uncomfortable.

Tags: Social Strategy / Paid Media / Content Production / SEO.

2. The Visual Layout (How to Code It)
This is where you show off your CSS Grid and React State skills.

The Layout Structure: Imagine a split screen (50/50) on Desktop.

Left Side (The Menu): A static list of the service names. Huge font size (text-6xl or larger).

Right Side (The Preview): A designated "Stage." When you hover over "Brand Identity" on the left, the Right Side displays a 3D rotating logo or a glitching brand video.

The "Tech Flex" (Interaction):

Dark Mode: The unselected items are Grey (#333). The hovered item turns White and glows Electric Purple.

Light Mode: The unselected items are Outline Only (Stroke). The hovered item becomes Solid Black.

3. The Code Snippet (React/Tailwind Structure)
Here is a skeletal component for this "Hover Reveal" effect. You can drop this into your Services.js.

Why this works for your Portfolio:
State Management: It shows you can use useState in React to change content dynamically based on user interaction.

Conditional Styling: It handles the visual logic of "Active vs Inactive" states perfectly.

Visual Impact: It fits the "Gen-Z" vibe—big text, clean layout, immediate feedback when you move the mouse.

Part 1: The FAQ Section ("The No-Fluff Zone")
Agencies usually hide their prices and process. "Lumina" does the opposite. We answer the uncomfortable questions upfront. This shows confidence.

The Design: Brutalist Accordion.

Closed: Big text, solid border.

Open: Smooth slide down, aggressive answer.

Tech Flex: Animated rotation of the icon and smooth height transition.

The Content (Copy)
Q: How much does it cost?

A: We aren't cheap. If you want a £500 website, go to Fiverr. If you want an asset that generates revenue, we start at £3k. Quality code costs money.

Q: How long does it take?

A: Average build is 4-6 weeks. We don't rush excellence, but we don't waste time. We move as fast as you can provide feedback.

Q: Can you fix my existing WordPress site?

A: No. We build custom. We don't patch up old, slow legacy code. We burn it down and build it better.

Q: Do I own the code?

A: 100%. Once the invoice is paid, the keys are yours. No hostage situations.

The Code (FAQ Component)
Add this below your Services component.

JavaScript

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is this going to be expensive?",
    answer: "Define expensive. If you think investing in your business is a cost, we aren't a match. We build revenue-generating assets. Our custom builds start at £3,000."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use templates?",
    answer: "Never. Templates are for hobbyists. We code bespoke solutions tailored to your specific brand goals using Next.js and modern architecture."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you take over my Wix site?",
    answer: "No. We don't polish mediocrity. We migrate you off limited platforms and onto scalable, custom infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the turnaround time?",
    answer: "Typically 4-6 weeks for a full platform build. We sprint. We don't jog."
  }

Part 2: The Work Page ("The Receipts")
This page proves you can walk the walk. The vibe is "High Voltage."

The Visual Strategy:

Masonry Layout: Don't use a boring grid of perfect squares. Mix wide rectangles with tall vertical shots. It looks editorial.

Data Over Everything: Don't just show a pretty picture. Overlay the stats immediately.

Imagery: Use standard website screenshots, but put them inside "glitchy" device frames or floating in 3D space.

The Content (The Projects)
1. Project: NEON DRIFT

Type: eCommerce / Fashion

The Tech: Shopify Headless + Next.js

The Stat: +400% ROI

Vibe: Underground streetwear brand. Dark aesthetics.

2. Project: APEX FINANCE

Type: B2B SaaS Platform

The Tech: React Dashboard + Firebase

The Stat: 2.1s Load Time (Down from 8s)

Vibe: Clean, corporate but edgy, data visualization.

3. Project: VELVET CULT

Type: Event Booking Site

The Tech: Custom Booking Engine

The Stat: Sold Out in 10 Min

Vibe: Nightclub, loud colours, motion heavy.

The Code (Work Grid Component)
This component uses a CSS Grid approach to make the first item span two columns (the "Hero Project").

JavaScript

The Contact Section and the Technical Setup Guide so you can actually start coding this today.

Part 3: The Contact Section ("The Portal")
We don't do "Please fill out the form below." That is weak. This form needs to feel like entering a command into a terminal. It is the destination of your smooth scroll.

The Copy:

Headline: START THE CHAOS.

Sub-headline: You’ve seen the work. You know the vibe. Let’s build something that scares your competitors.

The Button: [ INITIATE LAUNCH ]

The Interaction:

Inputs: No background colour. Just a thick bottom border. When you click, the border turns Electric Purple and glows.

The "Vibe" Dropdown: Don't ask "Service Type." Ask "What’s the mission?" with options like "Total Rebrand", "Kill the Competition", or "World Domination".

The Code (Contact Component)
Add this as the final section of your page. Note the id="contact"—this is what makes the link in your nav bar scroll down to here.

JavaScript

import React from 'react';

const Contact = () => {
  return (

Part 4: The Build (How to actually start)
Since this is for your portfolio under Empower Digital Solutions, we want a clean, professional setup.

Step 1: Open your terminal
Navigate to where you keep your coding projects.

Step 2: Create the Next.js App
Run this command. It will set up React, Tailwind, and everything you need automatically. (Select "Yes" for all default options).

Bash

npx create-next-app@latest lumina-portfolio
Step 3: Install the Animation Library
We need Framer Motion for the smooth transitions and the typewriter effect.

Bash

cd lumina-portfolio
npm install framer-motion
Step 4: Configure the Fonts
Go to layout.js (or layout.tsx) and import your Google Fonts so they work everywhere.

JavaScript

import { Syne, Space_Grotesk } from 'next/font/google'

const syne = Syne({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-syne',
  display: 'swap',
})

const space = Space_Grotesk({ 
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-space',
  display: 'swap',
})

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${syne.variable} ${space.variable} scroll-smooth`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
Step 5: Configure Tailwind
Go to tailwind.config.js and add your brand colours and fonts so you can use classes like bg-electric-purple.

JavaScript

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  darkMode: 'class', // Important for the toggle!
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'electric-purple': '#BF00FF',
        'acid-green': '#CCFF00',
        'void-black': '#050505',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        display: ['var(--font-syne)'],
        body: ['var(--font-space)'],
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Final Checklist for You
Smooth Scroll: Notice in Step 4, inside the <html> tag, I added scroll-smooth. This is the CSS magic that makes the page glide when you click "Contact".

Dark Mode: You will need to build a small button in your Navbar that toggles the dark class on the <html> element.
